## Basics of **DevOps**
### Documentations:
- Purpose
- Errors
- Troubleshooting

_Before the DevOps concept,_

Dev (development) was agile which can be driven into iterations  
_but_  
Ops (operations) was still waterfall

### CI (Continuous Integration)
The continuous/automated fixation of the each and every codes.
Automatic build and test of codes.

Goal of **CI** is to detect defects at a very early stage so that it does not multiply.

### CD (Continuous Delivery)
The continuous/automated process of the delivery of code changes to servers.

### Requirements
- Coding (Python)
- Fundamentals of Linux
- Computer networking
- Tools
- Infrastructure as Code (Bash)
- Cloud computing
- CI/CD Pipeline

### Important directories:
- **Home Directories:** /root,/home/username

- **User Executable:** /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin

- **System Executables:** /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/sbin

- **Other Mountpoints:** /media, /mnt

- **Configuration:** /etc

- **Temporary Files:** /tmp

- **Kernels and Bootloader:** /boot

- **Server Data:** /var, /srv

- **System Information:** /proc, /sys

- **Shared Libraries:** /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib
